# access-controller-backend
Backend for the Makerspace access control system, written in express.js

To get it up and running:

Check it out
cd into the directory 
npm install  to install dependencies.

NB: Will need to disable the login check unless running on a single host behind a proxy otherwise the frontend/backend cannot share the httpOnly login cookie.
